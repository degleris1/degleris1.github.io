**Electrical Engineering PhD @ Stanford** \\
*Optimization and power systems*

I'm currently a 5th year PhD candidate studying optimization and market design for the electricity grid.
My focus is on developing computational tools for long-term grid planning problems.
I'm grateful to be supported by the Stanford Graduate Fellowship and the DOE Computational Science Graduate Fellowship.

## Teaching

* From 2017 to 2020, I TA'd [ENGR 108 (Applied Matrix Methods)](https://stanford.edu/class/engr108/) under Professors Stephen Boyd, David Tse, and Brad Osgood.
* In 2022, I redesigned the lecture notes for CEE 272R (Engineering Future Electricity Systems) in collaboration with Professor Ram Rajagopal.
